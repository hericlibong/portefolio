Hello and welcome to my blog,

My name is HÃ©ric Libong.

After a long career as a journalist, I decided 7 years ago to transition into data science first and then into development.

Python is my primary programming language.

I am an expert in web scraping techniques and data extraction.

My development environment is the Django framework.
