An approach to retrieving the Fifa men ranking using the hidden API of the Fifa website.
It is also an update of an article published on [Medium in April 2023](https://medium.com/@rico69/scraping-fifa-mens-ranking-with-scrapy-and-hidden-api-7799570b7737).

This script uses [Scrapy](https://scrapy.org/) and allows you to retrieve both the current ranking and the history in just a few seconds.

The Python version used is 3.12, but the program can run with at least 3.9.
